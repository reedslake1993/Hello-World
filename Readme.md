This is me, passionate quick learner, but never code before.
Want to challenge myself to learn new things.
If you cannot code, it is hard for you to say you are an engineer.
want to learn more and contribute more, it is like the new experience that makes you so happy.
any way, it is the first step.

Celebrate the hello world project 
it is like a blog that record my daily life
